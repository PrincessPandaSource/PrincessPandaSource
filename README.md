## ü§ç I publish a *Sonic the Hedgehog* fan semi-autobiographical webcomic, *Silver Scripts*, which is based on my college life and computer science journey. Check it out [here](https://princesspandalover.netlify.app/silverscripts/)! ü©µ
![Blaze is shown on a video call screen holding up a realistic drawing of a non-anthropomorphic wolf and saying, 'I may be a good artist, but AI may REPLACE artists. Companies may use AI instead to save money.' She then puts it down, looks at the camera, and says, smiling, 'Fortunately, I'm majoring in political science. I want to work for the government one day.' Silver, sitting at his desk with his laptop, says, 'Well, there's also the fear of AI replacing PROGRAMMERS too. And I'm studying to be one! Aren't programmers supposed to be at the top, while artists are near the bottom!'](https://princesspandalover.netlify.app/silverscripts/img/comics/Comic1.png)

***Disclaimer about usage of AI**: I use AI to assist me with my programming, such as to solve problems when I'm short on time. However, I make sure to understand the programming concepts it gives me, not merely have it spit out code and paste it without knowing exactly what it does. AI-assisted coding is different from generating AI art; coding is based on logical principles and art is rooted in human creativity. While I'm at it, I will **never** use AI-generated text and media in my programs.*

*Oh, and if you are wondering about the Scratch custom block colors and the unfinished Sonic Generations mod repositories, they were stupid stuff I made as a kid and put here for some reason.*
