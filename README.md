## ü§ç I publish a *Sonic the Hedgehog* fan semi-autobiographical webcomic, *Silver Scripts*, which is based on my college life and computer science journey. Check it out [here](https://princesspandalover.netlify.app/silverscripts/)! ü©µ
![Blaze is shown on a video call screen holding up a realistic drawing of a non-anthropomorphic wolf and saying, 'I may be a good artist, but AI may REPLACE artists. Companies may use AI instead to save money.' She then puts it down, looks at the camera, and says, smiling, 'Fortunately, I'm majoring in political science. I want to work for the government one day.' Silver, sitting at his desk with his laptop, says, 'Well, there's also the fear of AI replacing PROGRAMMERS too. And I'm studying to be one! Aren't programmers supposed to be at the top, while artists are near the bottom!'](https://princesspandalover.netlify.app/silverscripts/img/comics/Comic1.png)
